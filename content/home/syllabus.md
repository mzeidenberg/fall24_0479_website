## Office Hours

My office hours will be held on Zoom and in person this semester from 2-3 PM on Mondays and Wednesday and 1-2 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you want to meet me in person, come to my office in 419 Warren Weaver Hall.

The Zoom link for the Monday/Wednesday office hours is https://nyu.zoom.us/j/95768462807

The Zoom link for the Tuesday/Thursday office hours is https://nyu.zoom.us/j/95230883194

Please turn your camera on if possible when you connect.

If you are unable to log on at these times and would like to talk to me, please email me for an appointment.

The TAs will also be holding Zoom office hours. Times and link to be announced.

## Course Description

Extracting, transforming and analyzing data in myriad formats with traditional relational databases as well as non-relational databases. Data modeling, cloud databases, and API programming. Garnering insights using Python and current data analysis tools and libraries.

### Course Topics

* Python
* data formats and retrieving data:
  - data formats (JSON CSV TSV etc.)
  - retrieving data with Python (web, file system, etc.)
* working with Python data management packages (pandas, numpy)
* (a taste of) data analysis
  - descriptive statistics
  - linear and logistic regression
  - decision trees and random forests
* data visualization and plotting with Matplotlib
* relational databases using SQL:
  - SQLite
  - relational database design
  - Entity/Relationship (ER) diagrams
  - normalization
  - SQL syntax
  - basic create/read/update/delete
  - JOINs
  - aggregate queries
  - window functions
* NoSQL:
  - MongoDB (a JSON document database)
    + basic create/read/update/delete
    + querying

## Textbooks

The following books are all available for free online reading through the NYU library's [license](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276639&p=1845282) for Safari Books Online.  You can also purchase hard copies. 

* Data Science from Scratch, Second Edition, by Joel Grus
* Python for Data Analysis, Third Edition, by Wes McKinney
* Think Stats, Second Edition, by Allen B. Downey
* Using SQLite by Jay A. Kreibich
* Relational Database Design and Implementation, 4th Edition, by Jan L. Harrington

## Grading

I plan to use the following breakdown for grading.

* 5% - In-Class Exercises
* 5% - Attendence
* 25% - Homework
* 50% - Weekly Quizzes
* 15% - Final Exam

## In-Class Exercises

I will be posting exercises on Ed Lessons (see below) to be done during class.

You don't need to get these exercise right, but you do need to try to do them, that is, post some answer, in order to get credit for them.

If you post some answer to 80% of the problems I post, you will get full credit for them.

## Attendence

I will be using paper exit tickets to measure attendence. These will be handed out at the beginning of
class and collected at the end.  You will get full credit for attendence if you attend 80% of the 
class sessions.

I count attendence because research shows that students who come to class learn more.

## Homework

There will be a weekly assignment. It will be done on the Ed Lessons platform and auto-graded. If you
can't pass the auto-grading test, you will get partial credit for what you did do.

You get 10 grace days for assignment due dates, to be used as you choose. For instance, if you turn the first assignment in 2 days late, you will have 8 days left. The graders will track this for you. After you exhaust your late days, you lose 10% for each day late.

The grace day system is designed to handle any personal situations you have, like a religious celebration, a family gathering, a short illness, a lot of work from other classes, etc.

However, no assigments will be accepted after the due date of the final assignment. Grace days do not apply after that date.

## Quizzes and Exam

Starting in week 2, there will be weekly in-person, in-class quizzes that will take up the 20 minutes at the beginning of the second class of the week. These will be implemented using Brightspace, the Respondus Lockdown Broswer, and Ed Lessons. You may not take these quizzes remotely. Each quiz will focus on the most recent material covered in class, typically from the week before, although there may be some reference to earlier material as well; for instance the early Python programming is used throughout.

You may bring five printed or handwritten pages of notes to each quiz. You may not use any other devices other than the computer that the Lockdown Browser is running on. Some sites will be whitelisted in the 
lockdown browser.

I verify that students are there in person by using the paper exit tickets.

The final will be similar to the quizzes, but longer, and employing the same technologies. Like the quizzes, it must be taken in person.

I am taking this approach in part because it is [recommended by NYU](https://teachingsupport.hosting.nyu.edu/consultations/assessment/assessment-approaches/).

## Information about Ed

Ed is an online system that will be available via Brightspace. It has discussion and lessons features that 
we will be using. It is linked from Brightspace.

The assignments, quizzes, and final will all be implemented in Ed Lessons. The lecture slides will also appear there.

We will mainly use the discussions feature of Ed to allow students to ask questions outside of class. If
you have a question about the course material, post it on Ed Discussion so that other students can also 
see the answer.

## Personal Computers and Software

It is highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class. It is really a necessity, actually. Some 
students have used an iPad or other tablet, but I can't guarantee that this will work.

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your machine. It installs a lot of useful
software for Python-based data analysis and data science. I also recommend downloading and installing DataGrip and DB Browser for SQLite. The latter is freeware and the former is free to students. The IDE I use is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but there are a lot of other good ones out there. I also use Google Colab and JupyterLab for editing Jupyter Notebooks. I also sometimes use Spyder, which is good for browsing Pandas dataframes and other Python objects. Anaconda installs JupyterLab, Spyder, and VS Code, among other things.

## Disability Disclosure Statement

Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu) for further information. Students who are requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center as early as possible in the semester for assistance, although it can be done at any time during the semester.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department [statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) for more information.

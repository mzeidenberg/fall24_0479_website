* working with Python data management packages (pandas, numpy)
* (a taste of) data analysis
  - descriptive statistics
  - linear and logistic regression
  - decision trees and random forests
* data visualization and plotting with Matplotlib
* relational databases using SQL:
  - SQLite
  - relational database design
  - Entity/Relationship (ER) diagrams
  - normalization
  - SQL syntax
  - basic create/read/update/delete
  - JOINs
  - aggregate queries
  - window functions
* NoSQL:
  - MongoDB (a JSON document database)
    + basic create/read/update/delete
    + querying

## Textbooks

The following books are all available for free online reading through the NYU library's [license](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276639&p=1845282) for Safari Books Online. (Here are some [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1baUVxqR8Y8QV7qyCXf087jBVqJA-EkjE7j6AJvr2yO4/edit?usp=sharing) from the NYU library on getting the NYU license to work in O'Reilly's apps for iOS and Android). They can also be purchased in hard copy.

* Relational Database Design and Implementation, 4th Edition, by Jan L. Harrington

## Grading

I plan to use the following breakdown for grading.

* 5% - In-Class Exercises
* 25% - Homework
* 50% - Weekly Quizzes
* 20% - Final Exam

## In-Class Exercises

I will be posting exercises on Ed (see below) to be done during class.

You don't need to get these exercise right, but you do need to try to do them, that is, post some answer, in order to get credit for them.

If you post some answer to 75% of the problems I post, you will get full credit for them.

## Homework

There will be 5 to 6 assignments.

You get 10 grace days for assignment due dates, to be used as you choose. For instance, if you turn the first assignment in 2 days late, you will have 8 days left. The graders will track this for you. After you exhaust your late days, you lose 10% for each day late.

The grace day system is designed to handle any personal situations you have, like a religious celebration, a family gathering, a short illness, a lot of work from other classes, etc.

However, no assigments will be accepted after the due date of the final assignment. Grace days do not apply after that date.

## Quizzes and Exam

Starting in week 2, there will be weekly in-person, in-class quizzes that will take up the 20 minutes at the end of the second class of the week. These will be implemented using Brightspace, the Respondus Lockdown Broswer, and Ed Lassons. You may not take these quizzes remotely. Each quiz will focus on the most recent material covered in class, typically from the week before, although

You may bring five printed or handwritten pages of notes to each quiz. You may not use any other devices other
than the computer that the Lockdown Browser is running on,

There will be 13 quizzes. Each will be worth the same amount.  I will drop the three lowest scores. So you can choose to skip up to three if you like, although I don't recommend it. However, if you skip one, it will be included in the three that are dropped. There will be no makeup quizzes except in extraordinary circumstances.

The final will be similar to the quizzes, but longer, and employing the same technologies. Like the quizzes,
it must be taken in person.

## Information about Ed

Ed is an online system that will be available via Brightspace. It has discussion and lessons features that 
we will be using. It is linked from Brightspace.

The assignments, quizzes, and final will all be implemented in Ed. The lecture slides will also appear there.

## Personal Computers and Software

It is highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class.

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your machine. It installs a lot of useful
software for Python-based data analysis and data science. I also recommend downloading and installing DataGrip and DB Browser for SQLite. The latter is freeware and the former is free to students. The IDE I use is
Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but there are a lot of other good ones out there. I also use Google Colab and JupyterLab for editing Jupyter Notebooks. I also sometimes use Spyder, which is good for browsing Pandas dataframes and other Python objects. Anaconda installs JupyterLab, Spyder, and VS Code, among other things.

## Disability Disclosure Statement

Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu) for further information. Students who are requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center as early as possible in the semester for assistance, although it can be done at any time during the semester.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department [statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) for more information.
